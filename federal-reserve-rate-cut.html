        <h1>Federal Reserve Implements First Rate Cut Since 2020</h1>
        <div class="article-meta">By Vinay Yerramsetti | September 18, 2024</div>

        <p>In a major policy move, the Federal Reserve reduced its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points on September 18, 2024, lowering the federal funds rate to a target range of 4.75% to 5.00%. The unexpected size of the cut—double what many analysts had forecasted—marks the first rate reduction since 2020, signaling the Fed’s intent to sustain economic momentum amid shifting economic conditions.</p>
        <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell described the decision as a "recalibration" rather than the start of a prolonged easing cycle. “The U.S. economy is in good shape. It’s growing at a solid pace. Inflation is coming down. The labor market is in a strong place. We want to keep it there,” Powell said during a press conference. The move aims to address risks to economic growth while maintaining progress on taming inflation.</p>
        <p>The rate cut also reflects broader concerns about international economic uncertainties, including weakening global demand and trade tensions. Economists have debated whether the move could lead to increased capital flows into emerging markets, potentially stabilizing some foreign economies but increasing volatility in others.</p>
        <p>This decision highlights the Federal Reserve’s proactive approach to navigating a complex and evolving economic environment while balancing growth and inflation objectives.</p>
