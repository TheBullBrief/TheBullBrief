        <h1>Value Stocks Lead the Quarter but Falter After Fed’s Rate Cut</h1>
        <div class="article-meta">By Vinay Yerramsetti | September 18, 2024</div>
        <img src="federal-reserve.jpg" alt="Federal Reserve Building">
        <p>Value stocks, long overshadowed by their growth counterparts, have staged a strong comeback this quarter, outperforming growth stocks for much of the period. However, following the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut, value stocks faced a setback in September, raising questions about their durability in the face of changing economic conditions.</p>
        <p>Investors had initially turned to value stocks, drawn by their lower valuations and steady dividends. Sectors such as financials, utilities, and consumer staples led the charge, as economic recovery drove interest in companies with solid fundamentals.</p>
        <p>The rate cut, while beneficial for growth stocks, created headwinds for value stocks by narrowing profit margins and reducing their competitive appeal. As the market digests the full implications of this monetary shift, analysts are divided on whether value stocks will regain their momentum or cede ground to their growth-focused peers.</p>
        <p>The interplay between value and growth stocks is expected to dominate market discussions in the coming months as investors recalibrate their portfolios.</p>
        <p>Stay tuned to <strong>The Bull Brief</strong> for further updates on economic trends and analysis.</p>
