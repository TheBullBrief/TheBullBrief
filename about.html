            <h2>The Story Behind The Bull Brief</h2>
            <p>Vinay Yerramsetti: "One day, I was in my living room and decided to open YouTube on the TV. A video titled 'The Making of an Investment Banker' caught my attention. Funnily enough, I noticed it was uploaded by UVA Law School. As a proud Hoo, this only made me more eager to watch it. The keynote speaker, Jim Donovan—a managing director at Goldman Sachs—shared his insights on what it takes to become an effective investment banker. He covered topics like securing a position, succeeding in early roles, and excelling as a senior banker. One point that really resonated with me was his emphasis on the importance of reading The Wall Street Journal daily. He recommended reading one article on macroeconomic trends, one on industry developments, and one opinion piece each day. After following his advice and making The Wall Street Journal part of my daily routine, an idea struck me: Why not write my own pieces and start a club? And from that thought, the rest is history."</p>
